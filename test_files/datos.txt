Try to guess the movie time!
This movie is about a blue alien who's really bad at being bad, so he accidentally turns good, 
but then he accidentally creates a super-villain who turns out to be not so villainous after all. 
It's a story where the bad guy isn't really bad, and the good guy isn't exactly good either.
